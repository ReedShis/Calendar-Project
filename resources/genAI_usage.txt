GenAI used is Gemini 2.5

1. Generated a Bootstrap HTML form for the calendar event modal based on the lab's instructions, including fields for 
Event Name, Weekday, Time, Modality, Location, Remote URL, and Attendees. The initial prompt was refined to create a barebones form, omitting the JavaScript functionality that will be implemented in a later lab step.

2. Provided Generative AI my current index and script files to help me debug
what I was missing in my updateLocationOptions(). It helped me find that one of my variable names
was not consistent, and through consulting gemini I switched from using style.background
to updating display tag.

3. Asked genAI why i couldnt close out of my save event modal,
it taught me to add " data-bs-dismiss="modal" " to my button tags

4. I asked Gemini to assist me in where to start for the extra credit. It's recomendation was to make a global variable I could use as a 'flag' in my 
script file so that I may deliniate when I am updating an event versus making a new one
